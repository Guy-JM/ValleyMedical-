    <p>A specialised field of medicine that corrects hormone imbalances through the use of natural bioidentical hormones.</p>
    <p>Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) uses hormones derived from natural plant sources to replicate the body’s normal hormonal levels. Patients have found that BHRT with pellet implants is extremely effective. Implants, placed under the skin, consistently release small, physiologic doses of hormones that provide optimal therapy.

Unlike typical oral and transdermal forms of therapy, which can produce “roller coaster” hormone levels, resulting in mood and energy fluctuations for the patient, Qualgen's hormone pellets typically provide consistent and sustained hormone levels throughout the day for up to three to six months.

Since the hormones used are completely natural, pellet therapy is ideal for patients who want the benefits of a natural hormone without the drawbacks of a synthetic. These pellets are chemically identical to the hormones your body products every day (Qualgen has the purest bio-identical hormone pellets). BHRT is a safe, effective treatment which has been around for over 70 years!</p>
